The app starts with a front page and a button where you can go to the login page.
When you enter the login page, you can either login or if you donâ€™t have a login, you can press the sign up button. This will take you to the sing up page where you can sign up. The data from the sign-up page will be saved in the database.
When you have signed up, you can go back to the login page and login. This will then take you to the quiz. The quiz will tell you which answers are correct.
